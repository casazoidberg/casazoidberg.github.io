   <h1>Hello, this is my webpage!</h1>
      <p>
       I am not sure how to seperate the different sections but am hoping that this shows up as a paragraph of data.
       I am hoping to refine my skills in coding so that I can visualize some nicer web pages!
       This assignment has taught me the importance of ordering the tags that you put into code, as well as ordering of the starting and ending tags.
       Thank you for reading.

   <h2>About me:</h2>

      <p>
        I am a student at MSU Denver, hoping to finish up this class and learn a bit about coding.
        I am really enjoying how HTML shows up so directly on the web page, it is simply whatever is submitted!
        Using CSS should be really neat, as well as JavaScript to add style and fun interactivity for the person browsing to my page.
        This is a pretty neat application!
        I am hoping to figure out how to stylize and seperate sections, but if this shows up on the webpage, I will be happy.
        You can't win them all, and if things are working out alright, why mess with a good thing?
      </p>
